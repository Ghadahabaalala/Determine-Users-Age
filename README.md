# Determine-Users-Age
 A beginner-friendly C program that asks for the user’s birth year and the current year, calculates their age, and classifies them as adult or minor. It also shows which decade of life they are in (0–9 = first decade, 10–19 = second, etc.). Great for practicing input, calculations, and conditions in C.
